			        HKUST's campus location provides an excellent opportunity to use a seawater cooling system: an inexpensive and energy-efficient cooling system for centralized air conditioning plants. Compared to an air cooling system, seawater cooling systems save substantial amounts of energy. Water discharge is regularly monitored to assure compliance with environmental regulatory requirements. The large concrete block found about 200 metres offshore marks the seawater intake.

			      <div class="locationcontent">
			       The LED lights found on the seafront are a pilot project of the Climate 
					Group’s “LightSavers” program, which aims to transform how the world 
					is lit by demonstrating the potential ways in which LED lighting and 
					smart controls can curb greenhouse gas emissions and cut energy 
					costs. The program also aims to promote LED lighting on a global scale, 
					aiming to make cities brighter and safer at night. LED lights are now 
					used to light our piazza and the “Red Bird” sundial.
					Since December 2007, HKUST has adopted the HKBEAM (Building Environmental Assessment Method) 
					system’s Gold Standard as the minimum performance 
					level to be achieved for new buildings on campus. Find 
					out more about the Gold Standard here: https://www.

					afternoon when the sun is in the southwest. The offices and classrooms 
					in the academic building were designed with many windows and glass 
					curtain walls facing east, reducing solar exposure. The glass panes in 
					the Academic Concourse allow natural light in the morning when the 
					building is cool, while recent extensions provide shading. Tinted and 
					reflective coatings help reduce solar gain through windows.

					that compensatory planting should be made on site, in 
					at least a 1:1 ratio in terms of both quality and quantity. 
					During the construction of the Lee Shau Kee Campus 
					and Student Halls VII and IX, some of the removed 
					trees were either transplanted or compensated for 
					around the seafront, LG7 Lawn, Lee Shau Kee Campus 
					and Coastal Marine Lab areas.
